## Why this adapter?

There is no generic "Solinteg" support in ioBroker. The Solinteg WR speaks openly documented Modbus TCP, so it could in principle be read out with the generic `ioBroker.modbus` adapter and a manually entered register list - but that means re-entering 50+ registers by hand in the admin UI, with no code-level control over scaling, data types or object structure. This adapter instead talks Modbus TCP directly (via `modbus-serial`), the same way [ioBroker.zeptrion](https://github.com/bueste/ioBroker.zeptrion), [ioBroker.goodwe-sems](https://github.com/bueste/ioBroker.goodwe-sems) and [ioBroker.husqvarna-automower-connect](https://github.com/bueste/ioBroker.husqvarna-automower-connect) each talk directly to their respective device/cloud API, giving full control over register mapping, scaling and the resulting object tree - plus the option to actively control the inverter/battery (EMS write access, off by default).

## Compatibility

This adapter targets Solinteg's **INTEG-M Modbus register family**, shared across:

- Solinteg MHT series hybrid inverters (developed and tested against **MHT-25~50K-100**, 25-50 kW three-phase)
- Rebrands of the same hardware/register family: **Wattsonic** and **M-TEC Energy Butler** inverters (per the reference implementation below - not independently confirmed by this adapter's author)

Battery support is generic: the adapter reads whatever battery data the inverter itself reports over Modbus (SOC/SOH/voltage/current/power, min/max cell voltage), regardless of battery brand - it does not talk to the battery directly. Tested/developed against a **Dyness STACK100** (51.2 kWh, connected to the inverter via CAN/RS485), but any battery supported by the inverter should work the same way.

If your device uses the same register family but isn't listed here, please open an issue or PR - the goal is to cover the whole Solinteg/INTEG-M ecosystem, not just one specific inverter+battery combination.

## Register source and limitations (please read)

Register addresses in [`lib/registers.js`](lib/registers.js) are sourced from the official Solinteg Modbus TCP protocol documentation, cross-checked against [`wills106/homeassistant-solax-modbus`](https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-solax-modbus) (`custom_components/solax_modbus/plugin_solinteg.py`), which documents the identical INTEG-M register family also used by Wattsonic and M-TEC Energy Butler rebrands.

**Verified on 2026-10-05 against a real MHT-25~50K-100 (unit ID 255, Dyness STACK100 battery):** every register of the map answers, the 32-bit word order (high word first) and all scales are confirmed by plausible values (e.g. AC power -3601 W against battery power -3600 W). The PV registers could not be checked with real production yet (no PV connected at the time). The EMS control registers (`50xxx`/`52xxx` block) read back correctly, but their effect when WRITING has not been tested - check it carefully before enabling [EMS write access](#ems-write-access-controlling-the-inverterbattery).

Dyness battery cell-level detail beyond min/max cell voltage (16 individual cell voltages per module) is **not** available over Modbus at the inverter - only min/max cell voltage and their cell IDs are exposed there. Full per-cell detail requires the separate Dyness Cloud API/MQTT (`ems.dyness.com` Developer Center), which this adapter does not implement.

## Installation

Once this adapter is listed in the official ioBroker adapter repository, install it the normal way: **Admin -> Adapters -> search for "solinteg" -> install**.

Until then, an ioBroker administrator can add it manually on the ioBroker host:

```
iobroker url iobroker.solinteg
```

## Configuration

| Tab | Setting | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connection | Host / IP address | IP or hostname of the inverter (or Modbus TCP/RTU gateway) |
| Connection | Port | Modbus TCP port, usually 502 |
| Connection | Unit ID | Modbus unit ID, default 255 (Solinteg MHT inverters over Modbus TCP); 0-255 are accepted |
| Connection | Request timeout | Timeout per Modbus request, in seconds |
| Polling | Fast poll interval | How often power/flow values (PV, grid, battery) are read (default 5s) |
| Polling | Slow poll interval | How often energy counters and diagnostics are read (default 30s) |
| EMS control | Enable EMS write access | Off by default - see [EMS write access](#ems-write-access-controlling-the-inverterbattery) |

```

All PV/grid/meter/battery power-flow states are polled at the fast interval; energy counters, diagnostics and EMS registers are polled at the slow interval.

## EMS write access (controlling the inverter/battery)

The `ems.*` states (working mode, charge/discharge power target, import/export limits, battery SOC protection limits, ...) are always **read**, so you can see the inverter's current EMS configuration regardless of this setting. **Writing** to them is disabled by default: any attempted write is logged and ignored until "Enable EMS write access" is turned on in the instance configuration.

Only enable this if you actively want to control the inverter/battery (e.g. schedule charge/discharge power, cap grid export). Getting a register or scaling wrong here can put the inverter into an unintended operating mode - see [Register source and limitations](#register-source-and-limitations-please-read).

## Polling and efficient reads

[`lib/blocks.js`](lib/blocks.js) merges adjacent (or near-adjacent, small-gap) registers into as few `readHoldingRegisters()` calls as possible per poll cycle, instead of one Modbus request per register. Fast-group and slow-group registers are blocked independently and polled on their own interval.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

**`info.connection` stays `false` / no states update.**
Check host/port/unit ID in the instance configuration, and that nothing (firewall, VLAN separation) blocks TCP port 502 between the ioBroker host and the inverter. Check `info.lastError` for the actual error message and the adapter log (Instance -> Expert mode -> Log level `debug`) for the underlying Modbus error.

**How do I find my inverter's IP address?**
Check your router's/DHCP server's client list for the inverter (often shows up by MAC vendor prefix or a Solinteg-related hostname), or check the inverter's own display/WiFi setup app if it has one.

**Values look wildly wrong (huge numbers, negative where positive expected, etc.).**
Most likely a `u32`/`s32` byte-order or scaling mismatch for that specific register - see [Register source and limitations](#register-source-and-limitations-please-read). Please open a GitHub issue with the raw value from `info.rawResponse`-style debugging (enable debug logging) or the actual vs. expected value, so the register map can be corrected.

**Can I use this with a Wattsonic or M-TEC Energy Butler inverter?**
In theory yes, per [Compatibility](#compatibility) - these share the same INTEG-M register family. This hasn't been independently confirmed by the adapter author against that hardware; feedback (positive or negative) via a GitHub issue is very welcome.

**Nothing happens when I write to an `ems.*` state.**
EMS write access is disabled by default - see [EMS write access](#ems-write-access-controlling-the-inverterbattery). Check the log for a warning confirming the write was ignored.

## Security & privacy

- The adapter performs Modbus TCP against a device on your local network - no cloud account, no external API, no credentials to store.
- EMS write access (the only functionality that can change the inverter's behavior) is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled.
- Written values are range-checked against each register's documented min/max before being sent.

## Development

```
npm install
npm run lint
npm test          # unit tests (lib/registers.js, lib/modbusClient.js, lib/blocks.js) + package consistency check
```

Recommended additionally before every release:

```
npx @iobroker/repochecker@latest .
```

Pull requests are welcome, especially to verify/correct register addresses against real hardware, or to improve translations (currently English/German are complete; the other 9 languages use English text as a placeholder).

## Changelog

<!--
    Placeholder for the next version (at the beginning of the line):
    ### **WORK IN PROGRESS**
-->

### 0.1.6 (2026-10-05)

- Preparation for the ioBroker repository: translations of the admin texts and of the metadata (title, description, news) in all languages, square 512x512 icon, `common.tier`, updated dependencies (`@iobroker/testing` 6, release-script 5, adapter-core 3.4.3), prettier configuration, Dependabot configuration.

### 0.1.5 (2026-10-05)

- Fix: a register that currently holds its "no value" marker (the off-grid command register reads 0xFFFF when no command is pending) now clears its state instead of keeping a stale value (`ems.offGridSwitch` kept showing `true`).

### 0.1.4 (2026-10-05)

- Fix: states created by an earlier version keep their old `common.min`/`common.max`, which still caused a warning at every start for values the inverter reports outside the write range. The adapter now removes these limits from existing states at startup.

### 0.1.3 (2026-10-05)

- The default Modbus unit ID is now 255 (Solinteg MHT over Modbus TCP), not 1.
- Verified against a real MHT-25~50K-100: all 73 registers of the map answer, 32-bit word order and all scales confirmed. Fixes: `ems.chargeCutoffSoc` is read in 0.1 % but written in whole percent; the min/max of writable registers is checked in the unit of the state (before: against the raw register value, which rejected valid writes, e.g. 50 kW for a 0.1 kW register); `ems.offGridSwitch` no longer reports `true` when the register holds 0xFFFF (no command pending); state ranges are no longer published as `common.min/max` (they caused a warning on every poll for values the inverter legitimately reports outside the write range, e.g. import limit 650 kW); `info.firmwareVersion` is now text (`V10.6.4.4-3.10.13.0`).
- New states: `energy.acGenerationToday/Total`, `diag.temperatureR/S/T`, `diag.operationFlags`, `diag.armFaultFlags1/2`, `grid.backupPower`, `meter.gridExportToday/gridImportToday`, and the EMS settings `ems.upsFunction`, `ems.gridUnbalancedOutput`, `ems.batteryProtectionRelax`, `ems.batterySocProtectionOnGrid/OffGrid`, `ems.acCtrlPhaseA/B/CPower` (writable only with EMS write access).

### 0.1.2 (2026-10-05)

- Fix: the Modbus unit ID can now be set to any value from 0 to 255 (the admin field was limited to 1-247 and refused 255; 0 was treated as unset).

### 0.1.1 (2026-10-03)

- Renamed the adapter from "solintec" to "solinteg" (the npm package, repository and instance were misspelled; the manufacturer is Solinteg). The old package `iobroker.solintec` is deprecated. Migration: install `iobroker.solinteg`, create an instance, copy the settings, remove the old `solintec` instance.
- Fix: `info.connection` is only set to true after a real Modbus response, no longer merely because the TCP connection could be opened.

### 0.1.0 (2026-08-15)

- Initial release: reads PV, grid/meter and battery values from a Solinteg MHT-25~50K-100 hybrid inverter (Dyness STACK100 battery via CAN/RS485) over local Modbus TCP. Optional EMS write access is disabled by default.
